# Machine learning and data use cases

## Terminology clarification

```
Answer:Machine Learning can be done at any point in the data pyramid as its algorithmic power can overcome challenges with data quality.
```

### Order data pyramid needs

```
Machine Learning in production
Prtototype & Testing ML
Analysis
Prepartation and cleaning
Storage
Collection
```

|  Machine Learning in production      |   Prototyping & Testing ML                           | Analysis                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |------------------------------------------ |
|Deploy a machine learning model       |    Build a simple churn prediction model             |Analyze customer trends                    |
|Build an automated risk scoring model |    Run an A/B test of three different email templates|Build a weekly customer purchase dashboard |


### Modeling types

```
Answer: Supervised learning uses input features to learn patterns and predict the target variable.
```

### Find supervised and unsupervised cases

|                     Supervised Machine Learning                 |     UnSupervised Machine Learning         | 
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
|Identify which marketing communications were the most impactful  | Group products together based on          |
|Predict which customers are likely to purchase                   | Build customer segmentation to customize  |
|Predict which machines in a factory are likely to break and need maintenance|

### Job role responsibilities
```
Answer: A data analyst at a manufacturing company has spotted weird outlier data points in the readings from the machine sensors. He shared the results with the leadership and their decision is to build a machine learning model right away that will identify any outliers automatically in the operating system of the manufacturing machines and send a signal to the employees operating it.

| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------ |
|Build a sales dashboard.    |    Prototype a machine learning model on a laptop   | Re-write prototype machine learning model |
|Create an ad-hoc analysis   |    Design an experiment and run A/B test            | Design a customer risk scoring algorithm  |



#### Team structure types

|      Centralized        |                Decentralized                       |        Hybrid         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------ |
|There is one large department running all data operations|   Each product department has built their own data collection |Each office have hired their own data analysts|
|All data needs and functions are located in one team.  |   Each geography team owns their own independent data organization.|Critical infrastructure and data storage are owned by one team|
